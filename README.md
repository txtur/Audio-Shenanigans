# Audio-Shenanigans
A compilation of a variety of music and sounds intended for editing or casual enjoyment.

I do not own any of the music displayed, please don't come after me.

All songs are formatted following a simple structure : 
    Artist - Song Title
In the case of an ost track part of a subfolder, it will usually omit the artist for the OST number or game collection.
